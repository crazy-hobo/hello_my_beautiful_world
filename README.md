# hello_my_beautiful_world
I see trees of green, and skies of blue

My name is Omar, I like butterflies, and I'm trying to decide whether I should stay in school for an additional 7 years to get my Bachelors Degree in Civil Engineering, or if I should quit it all and learn Javascript on my own, and get a job writing code, so that I can work at music festivals in the future. 

And butthole.
